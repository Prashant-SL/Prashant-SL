      "I have started my web development journey back in October 2021 by joining coding bootcamp at <b>Masai School</b> built numerous small web applications. Learned technical skills here such as ReactJS, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, MongoDB, ExpressJS.",
      "I initially focused on learning and exploring different JS & CSS frameworks and libraries than to just stick around with only HTML, CSS and Javascript. Then after that I decided to opt <b>ReactJS</b> as main tech as it was perfect and easy to learn than others, so I started to make many projects with this library.",
      "After my course completion I got referred to a product-based e-Commerce company named IBO.com. Presently I am working here as Software Development Engineer - 1, since August 2022. Here I am working primarily on frontend."
